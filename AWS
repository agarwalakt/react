AWS
elasticity, on demand computing, availability.

s3 is the storage volume bucket
ec2 local storage
ec2 compute power

vpc(ec2 (instance), rds cache,) volume
high availability
elasticity
tolerant
scalability
rds - aws data base service for cataloging and customer infor
nacl- is like a firewall
internet gateway is like the modem which allows external internet to connect to our vpc
route table is like a router that helps the internet connection spread through the vpcs
internet ->internet gateways (igw) (attached to the vpc)->router table->nacl->
route table determines the data traffic flow

subnet is a smaller network within a larger network. each region can have one or more subnets
vpc can span multiple availability zones in a region. each region can have multiple subnets.
subnet can be public - internet access
subnet can be private- can talk to local other subnets and no internet access. subnet needs to be connected to a routing table without an internet gateway
internet->(vpc (internet gateway-> routing table -> NACL-> subnet (ec2), subnet (rds)))
instance type is the cpu, determines the hardware. (vcpu, storage, memory, network...)
ebs is the storage that comes along with the ec2 instance (can be configured)
ebs can be associated to any ec2 as long as they are int he same availability zone.
beter iops (input output operations per second). more the size of ebs, more iops the volume has
root volume comes along with the ec2.
